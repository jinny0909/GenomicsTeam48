External code referenced (David):
-Notebooks from class
-Initial FM index implementation was written purely based on lecture notes, but while debugging and searching for answers I came across an excellent implementation on GitHub: https://github.com/egonelbre/fm-index/tree/master/src. 
-I tried not to copy individual functions directly and mainly focused on restructuring my FMIndex class to isolate the actions of querying, resolving counts, and resolving offsets as the above implementation does.
